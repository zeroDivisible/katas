# singly-linked-lists

I had been trying to implement singly-linked-lists in Clojure, following [data-structures-clojure-singly-linked-list](http://macromancy.com/2014/01/16/data-structures-clojure-singly-linked-list.html) and doing TDD

## Usage

Tests can be run with

```
    $ lein test
```

While developing, because [lein-test-refresh](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh) is added to ``project.clj``, one can run

```
    $ lein test-refresh
```

and just hack :)
